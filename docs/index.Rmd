## Covid Report
This is a report on COVID in the United States. Specifically, it presents the number of *cases* and **deaths** in the country. There have been a total of `r get_total_cases()` COVID *cases* in the US, and `r get_total_deaths()` **deaths** from COVID in the US. 

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
